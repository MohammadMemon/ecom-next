        Legacy. Loyalty. Two Wheels & a Dream.
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>CycleDaddy</strong> isn't just a cycle store — it's a story of
        grit, love, and legacy on wheels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our founder, <strong>Ahmed Malkani</strong>, built this brand to honour
        his father — <strong>Mr. Usman Malkani</strong>, lovingly known as{" "}
        <em>"Malkani Bhai"</em> across Borivali. A man who ran a humble kirana
        store for 35 years, earned every handshake, and gave his son his first
        bicycle — even when money was tight and dreams felt distant.
      </p>

      <p>
        After losing the kirana business to rising retail chains, his father
        shifted gears. He entered the world of cycles — helping launch a local
        business in Goregaon, where his honesty and charm won the trust of top
        cycle distributors. But loyalty met betrayal. One day, he was asked to
        leave — no reason, no warning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>He didn't quit.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        He opened his own small shop — <strong>Cycle Center</strong> — right
        where the kirana once stood. But the location was quiet, business
        slower. Still, he showed up, every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, he helped grow another distant relative's bicycle business into a
        full-fledged showroom, pouring in contacts, sweat, and soul. And yet
        again, same betrayal pattern followed. False blame. No share. No credit.
        Another door shut.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          But legends don't beg for open ones — they build their own.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">
        CycleDaddy is that door.
      </h3>

      <p>
        A digital store born from the silence he was left in. A wheel turned not
        just by pedals, but by pain, purpose, and pride.
      </p>

      <p className="italic font-semibold">This isn't just a business.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          It's a son's rebellion. A father's unfinished ride. A comeback on two
          wheels.
